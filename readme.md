A fully asynchronous python ORM

-   Free software: Apache Software License 2.0
-   Documentation: <https://asyncorm.readthedocs.io>.

Features
========

WARNING: alpha version !!

WARNING: Work In Progress !!

**AsyncORM** is a fully async [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) inspired by the fantastic [django orm](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/)

**AsyncORM** currently only supports postgres, but its developed to be
"easy" to plug a number of different database interfaces.

It is designed to be used with any async library, but with
[sanic](https://github.com/channelcat/sanic) in mind.

To do
=====

A number of things are needed to be able to release asyncOrm as a
production ready ORM:

-   better the documentation!
-   migration support (forward migration at least)
-   other databases interfaces ( [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) /
    [mariaDb](https://mariadb.org/) first priority)
-   [prefetch\_related](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/models/querysets/#prefetch_related%20support)
    functionality
-   Missing Field types: OneToOneField

Dependencies
============

AsyncOrm currently only depends on AsyncPg and netaddr.

[asyncpg](https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg), is a database
interface library designed specifically for PostgreSQL and
Python/asyncio.

[netaddr](https://github.com/drkjam/netaddr), A network address
manipulation library for Python
